Okay, this is a significant shift! Moving everything to the frontend makes ADIT a self-contained, privacy-focused tool. Here's the updated development checklist based on the frontend-only, local-processing PRD:

Development Checklist: AI Document Insights Tool (ADIT) - Frontend Edition

[ ] Integrate Local AI Inference Library (Transformers.js/ONNX Runtime Web) (FR-3).
[ ] Implement logic to load the local AI model into the browser environment.
[ ] Implement function to execute AI inference locally using the prompt and extracted text.
[x] Implement AI response parsing logic (handle JSON output from the model in JavaScript) (FR-3) - Implemented with fallback to text if not valid JSON.
[x] Implement Optional Cloud AI Fallback:
[x] Develop UI element for user to securely input API key (if they choose) - Implemented in ApiConfiguration component.
[x] Implement conditional logic to call the external Cloud AI API (OpenAI) instead of the local model - Implemented with OpenAI API integration.
[x] Handle external API calls (fetch API, error handling, response parsing) - Implemented in openaiUtils.ts.
FR-4: Interactive Refinement Module (Client-Side)
[x] Develop logic to generate/display clarifying questions based on initial AI analysis - Implemented follow-up questions system.
[x] Implement JavaScript logic to capture user responses from HTML forms (FR-4) - Implemented in FollowUpQuestions component.
[x] Develop JavaScript logic to modify the AI prompt based on user input - Implemented conversation memory system.
[x] Trigger re-run of local AI inference (or optional cloud call) with the refined prompt (FR-4) - Implemented with maximum question depth control.
FR-5: Recommendation Engine (Client-Side)
[x] Develop JavaScript logic to extract metadata suggestions from the (local or cloud) AI response - Basic results display implemented.
[x] Develop JavaScript logic to determine and add vectorization strategy recommendations (suggesting lightweight/local-friendly models like MiniLM) (FR-5) - Basic recommendations UI implemented.
[x] Ensure AI-provided explanations are extracted and formatted (FR-5) - Basic explanation display implemented.
Error Handling & State Management
[x] Implement robust error handling for file reading, extraction failures, AI model loading issues, and inference errors (low memory, etc.) (NFR-5) - Basic error handling implemented.
[x] Manage application state (upload progress, processing status, results) within the browser - Using React state management.
Phase 3: UI/UX Development

[x] Develop UI component for file upload (drag-and-drop, file selector) (FR-1) - Implemented in FileUploadSection.
[x] Display processing status clearly (e.g., "Reading file...", "Extracting text...", "Analyzing with local AI...", "Done!") (NFR-1) - Implemented with progress indicators.
[x] Develop UI components for interactive refinement questions and user input (FR-4) - Implemented in FollowUpQuestions component.
[x] Design and develop UI to display results clearly (metadata suggestions, vectorization recommendations) (FR-5) - Implemented in ResultsSection with tabbed interface.
[x] Implement responsive design for mobile/desktop compatibility (NFR-2) - Implemented with responsive CSS.
[x] Ensure accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation) (NFR-3) - Basic accessibility implemented.
[x] Implement progress indicators for file processing and AI analysis (NFR-1) - Implemented with percentage display.
Phase 4: Performance Optimization & Offline Capability

[x] Implement Web Workers for non-blocking file processing (NFR-1) - Implemented for spreadsheets, JSON, and text files.

Phase 5: Build, Packaging & Documentation

[ ] Configure build tool (Webpack/Vite) for production build (minification, bundling).
[ ] Ensure local AI model files are correctly included/referenced in the build output.
[ ] Create the final distributable package (e.g., ZIP file containing index.html, bundled JS/CSS, model files) (PRD 7).
[ ] Create User Guide: Focus on:
[ ] Simple setup instructions ("Download ZIP, unzip, open index.html in Chrome/Firefox").
[ ] How to use the tool (upload, refine, view/export results).
[ ] Browser compatibility notes.
[ ] Performance expectations and limitations (file size, device specs).
[ ] Highlighting the privacy aspect (local processing).
[ ] Instructions for the optional Cloud AI fallback usage (if implemented).
[ ] Create Technical Documentation:
[ ] Frontend code structure.
[ ] Key JavaScript libraries used and their purpose.
[ ] Build process overview.
[ ] Details on the prompt design strategy.
[ ] Information about the included local AI model(s).
Phase 6: Post-Release

[ ] Gather user feedback specifically on local performance, ease of setup, accuracy, and browser compatibility.
[ ] Track success metrics (focus on ease of setup/use - PRD 9).
[ ] Identify performance bottlenecks on different devices/browsers.
[ ] Plan for future enhancements based on revised PRD 8 (WebGPU, more formats, potential optional server version).

- [x] Added Maximum Tokens feature to control response length and manage API costs
- [x] Enhanced Maximum Question Depth feature to properly iterate through multiple rounds of follow-up questions
- [x] Implemented conversation memory system to maintain context across multiple question rounds
- [x] Fixed input handling for the Maximum Tokens field to ensure users can type numeric values
